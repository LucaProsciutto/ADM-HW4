In the first part of this homework we implemente a simplified version of Shazam by dealing with hashing algorithms. In particular, we implemente our LSH algorithm that takes as input an audio track and finds relevant matches.

In the second part of the homework we play with a dataset gathering songs from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference. The tracks (songs) include much information. We focus on the **track information**, **features** (extracted with librosa library from Python) and **audio variables** provided by Echonest (now Spotify). The final goal is to group songs into similar genres.

Ih this repository there is only one file, `ADM-HM04.ipynb`, that contains all the runned cells and the relative outputs for each request and all the functions that we have implemented.
